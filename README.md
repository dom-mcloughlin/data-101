## Data Learning Paths

Please check out below the Data Learning Paths!

These are split to beginner -> advanced data concepts to aid in self development.

- :mechanical_arm: [Data 102 Learning Objectives](data_learning_paths/data_102.md)
- :crystal_ball: [Data 103 Learning Objectives](data_learning_paths/data_103.md)

# data-101: An introduction to big data in Made Tech (basic tutorial)

Welcome to the data-101 intro section!

You can find the core learning path below to introduce you to some core data engineering concepts, this is a series of concise modules aiming to take an engineer with no data experience to feeling competent when presented with a data focussed project.

To expand upon the core learning modules please check out the learning objectives folder where you can see some of the key learning objectives for each data engineer level, and resources to help you achieve those learning objectives.
