# pandas

Nope, not the fluffy East Asian Bear - the Python package.


> pandas is a Python package providing fast, flexible, and expressive data structures designed to make working with “relational” or “labeled” data both easy and intuitive. 
> It aims to be the fundamental high-level building block for doing practical, real-world data analysis in Python. 
> Additionally, it has the broader goal of becoming the most powerful and flexible open source data analysis/manipulation tool available in any language.

For our purposes pandas offers a simple introduction to pragmatic data analysis. Panda is a software library for Python offering tools for data manipulation and analysis. You can utilise it a a sort of pythonic spreadsheet!

>Stefanie Molin is a data scientist and software engineer at Bloomberg LP in NYC, tackling tough problems in information security, particularly revolving around anomaly detection, building tools for gathering data, and knowledge sharing. She has extensive experience in data science, designing anomaly detection solutions, and utilizing machine learning in both R and Python in the AdTech and FinTech industries.

This repo primarily serves as an accompanyment to her handbook: [Hands-On Data Analysis with Pandas ](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Hands-Data-Analysis-Pandas-visualization-ebook/dp/B08R67H7F5) but can be utilised in a standalone fashion.

Stefanie has detailed documentation on how to use this guide, I'd recommend using this for a full introduction to pandas. For those of you looking for the tldr, outlined below is a list of essential notebooks for learning pandas found in this extensive guide.
